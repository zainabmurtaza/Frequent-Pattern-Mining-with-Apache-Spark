# Frequent-Pattern-Mining-with-Apache-Spark
Association Rule Mining with Apache Spark; PySpark codes running in PySpark shells. I have performed co-occurrence analysis on a marginably sized dataset, to demonstrate a models ability indicative to consumer purchase probability. Co-occurrence analysis is useful for store layouts, identifying healthcare patients, and marketing. Our frequent pattern mining will utilize the purchase data collected from one month of operation at a real-world grocery store. The data contains 9,835 transactions or about 327 transactions per day (roughly 30 transactions per hour in a 12-hour business day), suggesting that the retailer is not particularly large, nor is it particularly small.  min_support, max_support, and confidence values are used to find and predict association rules.
